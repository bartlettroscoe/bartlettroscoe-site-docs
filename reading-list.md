## Introduction

This page lists some books about various aspects of software development and
software engineering that I have read over the years, especially during a
particularly intense period in the 2007-2008 time frame.  I provide a brief
overview of the content of each book and why I think it is useful (or
essential) to read the book and what to look for.  These books, along wtih the
personal application of the ideas presented in them over the next few years,
represent my basic education in software engineering.

To provide some context and motivation for this reading list, I describe my
background and experiences.  When I started my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering
in 1996 at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), I knew that I liked writing code
and I liked the challenge of learning and mastering the C++ language.  My
first C++ book was "C++ Nuts & Bolts for Experienced Programmers", 1995, by
Herbert Schildt, and I read that book cover-to-cover in about 2 days.  Then I
read Bjarne Stroustrup's book "The C++ Programming Language, 2nd Edition" a
few months after that.  While that book mostly just covered the C++ language,
Stroustrup made some references to writing tests and some other basic software
engineering best practices but it was very minimal (after all, this was a book
about a programming language, not software engineering).  Later my first year
of graduate school I was introduced to the book "Design Patterns", 1994 by the
Gang of Four, by a Computer Science Ph.D. student at CMU.  Armed with the
knowledge of C++ and Design Patterns, I set about writing a sizable amount of
software implementing advanced numerical algorithms for constrained
optimization as part of my Ph.D. work (the optimization package at that point
was called rSQP++ for reduced successive quadratic programming).

When I started working at Sandia National Labs in 2001 after my Ph.D., I
continued writing object-oriented parallel numerical software in C++,
extending my Ph.D. software package rSQP++ to support parallel computations
with MPI (where the name was changed from rSQP++ to MOOCHO).  Around 2003, I
added the source code (and history) for MOOCHO to the Trilinos project version
control repository.  Once in Trilinos, I created or significantly contributed
to many Trilinos packages.  By 2007 I had written a lot of software and was a
prolific contributor to Trilinos (the largest contributor to Trilinos in terms
of number of commits and lines of source code).  During that entire period
from 1996 till 2007 I believed that I was writing quality object-oriented C++
software.  Then, in 2007, I began reading a larger portion of the modern
software engineering literature (some of which is highlighted in the lists
below) and came to realize my own knowledge gap in best practices for creating
and maintaining quality software.  After this realization, I began applying
many of the software engineering best practices to my CSE projects and
realized significant improvements in productivity and the overall quality of
the software I was writing. However, I was also horrified to realize that,
prior to gaining this knowledge, I had created tens of thousands of lines of
CSE software of insufficient quality and that I was now in a position have to
maintain.

It is my hope that this reading list we be useful and will help motivate
others to go on the same journey.  Once you are armed with this knowege, there
is no going back!
